            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>25 New Faces of Independent Film | Filmmaker Magazine</h1><p>The summer used to be a slow period for independent film, so what better time to focus our readers' attention on the up-and-coming artists who'd be shaping the next generation? That's what we were thinking back in 1998, when we decided to devote our Summer issue to what has become our most celebrated feature of the year, the "25 New Faces of Independent Film."</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/680e604913e11943fa7f428ce52d819b445f2d95.jpg"></article>]]></description>
